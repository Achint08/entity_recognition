You said that you like to do more low-key things like go to a park or library, but it's always good to have even just a few dollars of 'fun money' remaining in your budget each month.\n\nI think that couponing to save money on food and get more bang for your buck is your best bet. It's easy to do and there are some great sites for coupons out there that you can print coupons from at home! My favorites are\n\n-Smartsource.com\n\n-Coupons.com (this is one of the biggest)\n\n-Redplum.com\n\n-Thekrazycouponlady.com\n\nAlso, your local Sunday newspaper should have coupon inserts in them if you're worried about wasting printer ink and don't want to go that route. I know that's where the majority of coupons people get come from, but I prefer online because I can search specifically for what I like to eat/buy as opposed to just hoping that the Sunday inserts will have what I want.\n\nLikewise, 'liking' facebook pages for different food brands and signing up for email news letters can get you coupons - tons of brands (like Uncle Ben's rice, Gilette Venus razors, coffee mate coffee creamer, and many more) will give out exclusive coupons to their FB 'fans' and newsletter subscribers!\n\nI'd also suggest looking online at the coupon/price matching policies for the grocery stores near you. For example, Walmart will happily accept coupon specifically made for other stores (even Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc), and price match ads for other local stores. My local Walmart will price match the ads for any stores in a 30 mile radius! I just print the pages I want off of the competitor store's website and bring them with me to the register. (Other stores will do this as well, but I think that Walmart is the most lenient.) \n\nSince you're in the south look into double coupon policies - that's where a store will double a coupon up to a certain amount, so your $1 off coupon is magically worth $2 at the register. I don't know how many stores do that, but it seems like every woman on that 'extreme couponing' show is from TN, MS, TX, etc so it's something to consider.","removal_reason":null,"subreddit":"Frugal","score_hidden":false,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t1_c95zlso","link_id":"t3_1bdeuf","edited":1364774595,"distinguished":null,"archived":true,"id":"c95zlso","downs":0,"score":2,"created_utc":"1364774403","controversiality":0}

Why should it?\n\nIn order to deny infinite regress it must.\n\n&gt;The second premise states that an infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite,  The point seems obvious enough, for if there has been a sequence composed of an infinite number of events stretching back into the past, then the set of all events in the would be an actually infinite set.\n\n&gt; But manifest as this may be to us, it was not always considered so. The point somehow eluded Aristotle himself, as well as his scholastic progeny, who regarded past events as a potential infinite.  Aristotle contended that since things in time come to exist sequentially, an infinite never exists at any one moment only the present actually exists. Similarly Aquinas after confessing the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite nevertheless proceeded to assert the existence of the infinite regress of past events is possible.  This is because the series of past events does not exist in actuality.  Past events do not now exist, and hence do not constitute an infinite number of actually existing things.  The series is only potentially infinite, not actually infinite, in that it is constantly increasing by the addition of new events.\n\n&gt;These Aristotelian thinkers are clearly presupposing an A-Theory of time and an ontlology of presentism, according to which the only temporal items which exist are those that presently exist.  On a B-Theory of tenseless time, since there is ontological parity among all events, there can be no question that an infinite temporal regress of events is composed of an actually infinite number of events. Since all events are equally real, the fact that they exist (tenselessly) at different times loses any significance\n\n*Natural Theology* page 115\n\nSuffice it to say that a large part of the argument against a past infinite universe requires A Theory.  Other arguments might be offered but they all have reasonable escapes (namely the appeal to entropy and Borde-Guthe-Vilenkin Theorem).  Disallowing an actual infinite procession of events is very important to how robust the actual argument is, and an actual infinity existing in a series of tenseless moments cannot mesh with this line of reasoning.\n\n&gt;That \"there is no prior state\" is already what the kalam argument says in the first place.\n\nIt does not.  The three supports of the first premise are:\n\na) Intuition that no things comes are produced from nonexistence.\n\nb) That \"nonexistence\" holds no preference as to creating universes\n\nc) Disagreement with current observation of things (especially universes) not coming into existence without cause\n\nThese all presuppose that a state of \"nonexistence\" is a thing which it makes sense to talk about.

As early entrants into their markets, they fought their way through chaotic competition by strictly controlling costs and increasing efficiency at every step. By making transportation, steel, and oil far cheaper and more widely available, they contributed to the rapid growth the American economy, and the creation of tremendous wealth.\n\nNot everyone was happy with these developments. The rise of large companies also gave rise to a new class of lifelong wage workers (by contrast with earlier generations, which had anticipated owning their farms or shops). Unionization and strikes increased rapidly after the Civil War. Starting in the 1870s, workers demanded laws to limit the workday to eight hours.\n\nFarmers, too, felt helpless before the railroads\u2014\u201cthe greatest and most powerful monopoly on the face of the earth,\u201d in the words of one orator. \u201cThey let the public feel their power in the fuel of their kitchens, the bread of their bodies, the material for their houses.\u201d Cheaper transportation integrated the national marketplace, putting farmers in distant regions into direct competition with each other. And railroads gave discounts to large, long-distance shippers; farmers who sent their harvest and livestock over short distances to local markets resented paying a higher rate per mile.\n\nAs with workers\u2019 demands for eight-hour laws, agrarian radicals wanted government action. One council of Grangers declared, \u201cWe hold that a state cannot create a corporation that it cannot thereafter control.\u201d Another speaker said, \u201cThe time would come when the management of the roads must fall into the hands of the public.\u201d\n\nThis call for public regulation, even ownership, marks a major shift in politics. Gone were the days when Jacksonian radicals wanted the government to stay out of the economy, to allow individuals to rise on their merits. Now those on the left embraced government intervention as a means of countering the new power of large corporations, which towered over the economy as no businesses had before the Civil War.\n\nIt took decades for this kind of regulation\u2014especially federal regulation\u2014to emerge. Yet even before the death of Cornelius Vanderbilt in January 1877, the modern argument over private enterprise and the role of government had clearly emerged. In a sense, it does not matter whether one sees Vanderbilt and his peers as robber barons or captains of industry; it is the fact that we argue about them as one or the other that matters most. They not only changed the way we live\u2014they changed the way we think."}

What evidence do I have that this is much larger than one mans r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\n\nYou are one of the first, if not the first, to bring the plight of Chinese rail workers to my table. Nobody is thinking about that today. Nobody. They'll think VT Killer before that. How's that for machismo?\n\nWriting this while in East Asia as a white America, those same themes you mention are ever-present: the Momma's boy versus the Marlboro Man. It's cultural, and it has weight because there is indeed an established cultural history that reinforces it. Did you have a Tiger Mom? I know I didn't.\n\nLastly, I can confirm that what you describe does give a pattern of Xenophobic behavior, because people do the same thing to foreigners in Korea. Dunkin Donuts currently has a marketing campaign featuring a zany wired white guy who has clearly drank too much coffee. Foreigners are given comedy roles as the pratfall and slapstick guy like its a minstrel show. So, given your description, I feel like we're brothers ;)\n\nMy advice is to pay attention to what's actually happening now: pay attention to the movies coming out of China and Korea, and Hollywood's willingness to adapt them. You should promote your country's native film industry whenever possible cuz there's a lot of interesting stuff in there.\n\nIt's still going to take a while for the Midwest and Deep South to accep a leading Asian man, and Hollywood knows this. Don't use that as a crutch, however, if you're looking for a cultural scapegoat of any women problems you might have.

On one hand, the chances of getting in, especially to top ranked schools, jumps up considerably. However if you are rejected then you cannot reapply for admission under regular decision. You can also be deferred in which case you can apply again. However, you must also realize that you need to sign a contract that is BINDING. When you ED a school and get in you MUST go. I'm not even sure how you would go about getting out of ED without it ending very, very badly for you. You also are not allowed to apply to any other schools in the ED process otherwise the school reserves the right to rescind your application. This is why my college counselor told me ED should really be reserved for your \"dream school\", or a school you really, really like but don\u2019t have as much of a shot at in RD.\n\nThere is also early action. Early action is non-binding, and you can EA to as many schools as you like. However I don't think EA increases your chances as much to get in as ED but I do not know about admissions statistics for EA as fewer schools use EA compared to ED. \n\nSome schools also have ED II where they have a second round of early decision prior to the regular decision deadline. This is just another shot at ED but later in the admissions process.\n\nIn terms of \"chances\", it only helps you, but there are just some major caveats to it. You cannot get cold feet, and you have to be content with the fact that if you are rejected, you need to move on. Don't waste ED, on either a school you are unsure you'd be happy at or a school you already had a good shot at getting in to.\n","removal_reason":null,"subreddit":"college","score_hidden":false,"author_flair_text":"Little Ivy","gilded":0,"name":"t1_c95zm85"}

The kid is a stud but its just hard to see him as good as he was last year consistently.\n\nBraun brings his second PED accusation to the table, doubt it affects this season but you never know. \n\nBoth these gentlemen are OF, the deepest position in the sport.  \n\nMiggy is by far the safest and best choice at #1, why?\n\nHe plays 3rd, a weak position. He is a better offensive player then every player mentioned (not counting steals), including Cano. He is apart of one of the best offenses in baseball right now. And he rarely gets hurt... Oh and consistency, name the player who has been more consistent then him. \n\nOh did I mention he is in his prime...\n\nAny person who has a chance to draft him, and does not will be regretting it come the end of the season. Just like last.

Unfortunately that isn't how reddit works.\n\nIt is because the content of a picture can be absorbed so quickly that makes them a problem. On reddit votes per minutes is everything. The chances of something making it to the front page depends on how quickly it receives its first 10 upvotes which are weighted as high as the next 100 which are weighted as high as the next 1000. The faster something can be absorbed the quicker it gets upvoted and the more likely it is to make it to the front page. The longer it takes to absorb the content the more likely it is to slip away from the new page before it gets upvoted.\n\nThe more submissions per minutes the bigger a problem it becomes because content leaves the new page much quicker. As I said in another post it isn't a big problem yet but as more people join the more karma whoring posts show up. They move to the front page while articles, videos, and albums that would have started interesting debate slip away never to be seen again.\n\nIf you want a good comparison of two subreddits about the same topic where one bans pictures and the other doesn't check out the difference between /r/gaming and /r/games.\n\n[How reddit ranking algorithims work.](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588)","parent_id":"t1_c95ybim","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi6d","author":"da1hobo","retrieved_on":1431716827}

I got out the phone, dialed 911 and ran to the scene. He was coherent and lifted the face shield of his helmet. He said his ankle hurt. I looked down at his ankle, kind of pinned under the bike, and his bone was completely sticking out. Like the ankle was separated and just hanging on by a couple strands. He asked me how bad it was and I lied. I said, \"it looks fine man, you'll be ok, just hang out until EMS gets here.\" I felt so bad for him. He had leathers and a helmet on so that was a plus. The biggest kicker of this story is that while I was kneeling next to him I heard a phone ring. I looked around and saw a cell phone about 10-15 ft from him. The motorcyclist said it was his phone so I ran over and grabbed it. I answered the phone and the voice on the other line said, \"Hey Mr. X this is John from Harley Davidson just was checking in to see how your new bike is doing.\" I just hung up the phone...and I told him it was a solicitor. \n\nEither way, it's a nasty thing to see a bone sticking out but my gut instinct was to help the dude out.

These reforms are simply extensions of the reforms undertaken by New Labour during the Blair years - reforms that by and large, reduced waiting times and improved satisfaction.  They're not perfect, and I'd argue it's too much too fast, but people are incapable of disassociating their politics from fact when it comes to Tories and the NHS.
